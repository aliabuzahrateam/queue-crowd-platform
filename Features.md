# SPEC-1-Queue-and-Crowding

## Background

Public sector institutions such as ministries, hospitals, and public service offices face daily challenges in managing citizen queues and digital service load surges. Long wait times, lack of real-time updates, and inefficient service allocation create frustration and reduce operational efficiency. Similarly, traffic spikes on digital platforms during critical periods lead to downtime and poor user experience. A comprehensive system that combines queue ticketing and application crowding control is essential to streamline visitor flow and ensure consistent digital access.

## Requirements

### Queue Ticketing System
**Must Have**
- Users can obtain a queue ticket digitally or via kiosk.
- Users can select the required service when taking a ticket.
- Support for multiple branches/locations with independent queues.
- Real-time updates and estimated wait times shown to users.
- Staff can manage queues: call, skip, cancel, serve.
- Support for different queue types: normal, priority, emergency.
- Dashboard for configuring branches, services, and counters.
- Role-based access: staff, supervisors, administrators.
- Visual and/or audible notifications for called tickets.

**Should Have**
- Collect user feedback after service.
- Detailed reports: wait times, number served, etc.
- Notifications via screen display, mobile app, or printed ticket.

**Could Have**
- Integration with identity or other internal systems (e.g. service portals).

**Won’t Have (for MVP)**
- AI-based queue prediction or behavior analysis.

### Application Crowding Management
**Must Have**
- Monitor current number of users per application/service.
- Prevent new users from entering once a defined threshold is exceeded.
- Place excess users into a FIFO virtual queue.
- Show position and estimated wait time to queued users.
- Support configurable thresholds per service/app/time window.
- Role-based prioritization (e.g., staff > public).
- Integration with service applications to enforce access rules.

**Should Have**
- Real-time dashboard for admins.
- Alert admins when limits are exceeded.
- Block excessive or suspicious requests (rate limiting, IP blocking).
- Provide usage reports and crowding trends.

**Could Have**
- Multi-language support in user queue screens.
- Developer SDK or JS embed script to integrate monitoring.

**Won’t Have (for MVP)**
- Predictive scaling or AI-based auto-thresholding.

## Method

### Queue Ticketing System
- Modular architecture with microservices or modular monolith.
- PostgreSQL for relational data.
- Redis Pub/Sub + WebSockets for real-time updates.
- React-based frontends (admin, staff, kiosk, display).
- Role-based access control (OAuth2).

**Key Components:**
- QueueService, NotificationService, ReportingService, AdminConfigService, AuthService.
- Real-time ticket calling via Redis Pub/Sub.
- Ticket types and status transitions handled by a central queueing algorithm.

**Database Highlights:**
- `branches`, `services`, `counters`, `tickets`, `users`, `ticket_events`, `audit_logs`

### Application Crowding Management
- Acts as middleware or embedded SDK layer in front of apps.
- Redis to store session and queue data.
- Two thresholds: active session cap, and max queue size.

**Core Components:**
- Access Controller API, Session Manager, Queue Manager, Rule Engine, Admin Dashboard, JS SDK.
- Enforces FIFO virtual queue with session metadata.

**Redis Schema:**
- `queue:<service_id>`, `session:<token>`, `active_users:<service_id>`, `thresholds:<service_id>`

## Implementation

### Queue Ticketing System
1. Infra setup: Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, CI/CD
2. Backend services: queueing, configuration, reporting
3. Frontend UIs: Admin, Staff, Kiosk, Display
4. Real-time integration: Redis + WebSockets
5. Optional notification: SMS/email
6. Audit logs and analytics via Metabase/Superset

### Application Crowding Management
1. Provision Redis and containers
2. Implement core services: access control, queue manager, session TTL
3. JS SDK or proxy for apps
4. Admin UI for threshold management
5. Reporting, logs, alerting
6. Security: rate limits, abuse detection, RBAC
